# CoinConverse

## Overview

The CoinConverse is a web-based platform that leverages Ethereum addresses, the Sepolia blockchain network, MetaMask, react+vite, JavaScript, Solidity, and other industry-standard technologies to enable users to create unique accounts, add friends, and securely communicate with them. This application prioritizes the highest level of message security by employing encryption techniques and ensuring the storage of messages on the Sepolia blockchain network.

## Features
* Decentralized Accounts: Users can create their unique accounts on the platform using their Ethereum addresses, providing a decentralized and secure identity verification process.
* Friend Management: Users can add friends on the platform, establishing connections with other users and expanding their network.
* Secure Chat: Users can engage in highly encrypted conversations with their friends. The chat messages are stored on the Sepolia blockchain network, ensuring data integrity and immutability.
* Gas Fee Payment: Users need to pay a small gas fee for each message they send. This helps to prevent spamming and maintain a reliable and efficient messaging system.

## Technologies Used

* Ethereum: Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for account creation and transaction management.
* Sepolia TetstNet: Sepolia blockchain network is utilized for storing and retrieving encrypted chat messages.
* MetaMask: MetaMask is integrated into the application to enable Ethereum address management and transaction signing.
* React+vite: The front-end of the application is built using React+vite, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface and low latency at the same time.
* JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary programming language used for implementing the application's logic and functionality.
* Solidity: Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language, is used to develop smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.
* Web3.js: Web3.js library is employed to interact with Ethereum and Sepolia blockchain networks.
