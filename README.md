# CoinConverse

## Overview

The CoinConverse is a web-based platform that leverages Ethereum addresses, the Sepolia blockchain network, MetaMask, react+vite, JavaScript, Solidity, and other industry-standard technologies to enable users to create unique accounts, add friends, and securely communicate with them. This application prioritizes the highest level of message security by employing encryption techniques and ensuring the storage of messages on the Sepolia blockchain network.

## Features
